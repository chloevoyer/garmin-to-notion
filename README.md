Inspired by https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect.git (where you can find a not-so-complete dictionnary, and an example)  

Also inspired by https://github.com/n-kratz/garmin-notion.git 

You can ignore the personalrecords.py file because I haven't figured out yet how to update the database for new records against old ones, and I don't want to end up with multiple copies, so I only run it once (this file will not run in the YAML file)
