## Prerequisites :hammer_and_wrench:  
- A Notion account with API access.

## Getting Started :dart:
A detailed step-by-step guide is provided on my Notion template [here](https://chloevoyer.notion.site/Set-up-Guide-17915ce7058880559a3ac9f8a0720046).
For more advanced users, follow these steps to set up the integration:
### 1. Fork this GitHub Repository
### 2. Duplicate my [Notion Template](https://www.notion.so/templates/fitness-tracker-738)
* Save your Activities and Personal Records database ID (you will need it for step 4)
  * Optional: Daily Steps database ID
  * Look at the URL: notion.so/username/[string-of-characters]
  * The database ID is everything after your “username/“ and before the “?v”
### 3. Create Notion Token
* Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations).
* [Create](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) a new integration and copy the integration token.
* [Share](https://www.notion.so/help/add-and-manage-connections-with-the-api#enterprise-connection-settings) the integration with the target database in Notion.
### 4. Set Environment Secrets
* Environment secrets to define:
  * GARMIN_EMAIL
  * GARMIN_PASSWORD
  * NOTION_TOKEN
  * NOTION_DB_ID
  * NOTION_PR_DB_ID
  * NOTION_STEPS_DB_ID (optional)
  * NOTION_SLEEP_DB_ID (optional)
### 5. Run Scripts (if not using automatic workflow)
* Run [garmin-activities.py](https://github.com/chloevoyer/garmin-to-notion/blob/main/garmin-activities.py) to sync your Garmin activities to Notion.  
`python garmin-activities.py`
* Run [person-records.py](https://github.com/chloevoyer/garmin-to-notion/blob/main/personal-records.py) to extract activity records (e.g., fastest run, longest ride).  
`python personal-records.py` 
## Example Configuration :pencil:  
You can customize the scripts to fit your needs by modifying environment variables and Notion database settings.  

Here is a screenshot of what my Notion dashboard looks like:
